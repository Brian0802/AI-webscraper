AI Web Scraper
Overview
The AI Web Scraper is an intelligent, extensible, and highly configurable web scraping tool designed to extract structured data from websites. Leveraging AI techniques, it aims to adapt to varying website structures, identify relevant content, and handle common anti-scraping measures more gracefully than traditional rule-based scrapers. This project is ideal for data collection, market research, content aggregation, and more.
